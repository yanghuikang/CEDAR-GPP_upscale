# CEDAR-GPP Upscaling
This repository contains the primary code related to the generation of the CEDAR-GPP dataset, as detailed in the paper "CEDAR-GPP: spatiotemporally upscaled estimates of gross primary productivity incorporating CO2 fertilization". CEDAR-GPP was generated by upscaling eddy covariance GPP data with machine learning and satellite remote sensing data. 
### Directory Structure
- `model_generation`: code for the training and saving of ensemble XGBoost models.
- `model_deployment`: code for deploying the saved models to generate global GPP maps.
- `utils`: modules and scripts used for upscaling processed.
- `cfe_scalar`: code to compute the theoretical light-use efficiency response to CO2.
